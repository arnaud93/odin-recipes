    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This authentic Moroccan <strong>Shakshuka Recipe</strong> 
        features a diverse blend of North African spices,
        year-round vegetables, and 8 eggs for an abundance of protein. 
        It’s filling and absolutely full of flavor for a robust, 
        spicy breakfast unlike any other. 
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Saffron</strong> - 
            A very delicate spice. See the section below for more guidance.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong> - 
            We’re using more yolks than whites. Save the extra whites for other recipes, like a light cheesecake.</li>
        <li><strong>Harissa Paste</strong> - 
            This is a hot, bold, and tangy chili paste. Regular chili paste will do as a substitute, 
            or you could use your preferred hot sauce — though it will be thinner. </li>
    </ul>
